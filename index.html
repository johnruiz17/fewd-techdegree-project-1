        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am currently pursuing a new career in web development. I am starting off my journey by learning as much as I can about front end web development, and then later on I plan on learning more about back-end web development as well. What interests me about coding is that it can give me the ability to translate ideas into reality and share them with the world.</p>
        <p>In my spare time I like to write songs and produce music. One project that I am excited to work on is creating my own website for my music. </p>
