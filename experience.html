    <h2>Previous Work Experience</h2>
    <p>I have had many different jobs in the past. Currently I am a Customer Service Supervisor at Burlington. I have also worked as an Activities Coordinator, a summer camp Kids Group Counselor, and a Dining Ambassador. I have also worked at a calling center. The summer after I graduated high school I did a neuroscience research internship. </p>

    <h2>Programming in C++</h2>
    <p>The first time I was introduced to coding was the summer after my junior year in high school. I took an introductory C++ course and I programmed some basic user experiences. Now that I am learning at Treehouse I plan on improving my skills so that I can start a new career as a web developer. With Treehouse's outstanding teaching staff and learning resources, I am feeling optimistic about where this journey will take me.  </p>
